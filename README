Example usage:

    sh script.sh Untitled1.sfd Untitled1.sfd.palettes

This generates a file `Untitled1.sfd.colr.ttf` where FontForge foreground layers are color layers. The associated color palettes have to be specified in the file passed as second parameter.

This does not implement real input checking and error handling, so if something breaks you might dave to work through the scripts.

    build_colr.lua:51: assertion failed!

might mean that your input font does not contain any layered glyphs.
